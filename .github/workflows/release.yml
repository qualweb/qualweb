# This file's workflow invokes changesets to generate and publish a release.
# If pushing to the master branch, the changesets action is used to maintain a
# release-specific pull request, and trigger an actual release if that PR is
# merged.
# If pushing to develop, a snapshot release is published to the @develop tag
# instead.
# It's enough to trigger changeset's release process on the monorepo. It'll take
# care of all changed packages on its own.
